These cytokines activate several proinflammatory signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The interleukin-36Ra antagonist and the three agonists interleukin-36α, interleukin-36β, and interleukin-36γ, as well as interleukin-1RL2, are highly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the skin, trachea, and esophagus.20 Moreover, we have shown that the expression of interleukin-36γ agonist can be strongly induced in keratinocytes after treatment with immunostimulating agents such as interleukin-1β and poly(I:C).
