An additional mutant allele, found in a Jewish family of Algerian origin is characterized. Sequence analysis revealed a C to T transition at cDNA position 1037 which predicted a threonine to methionine substitution at residue 306 (designated T306M). It is highly suggestive, but not definitive, that this transition is the mutation causing CTX. A search for additional cases from Jewish families of North African extraction identified five new families including 10 cases. The three sterol 27-hydroxylase gene mutations account for all 10 CTX families and their presence may suggest the existence of positive selective forces that lead to an increased prevalence of this relatively rare disease in Jewish from North Africa."

These cytokines activate several proinflammatory signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The interleukin-36Ra antagonist and the three agonists interleukin-36α, interleukin-36β, and interleukin-36γ, as well as interleukin-1RL2, are highly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the skin, trachea, and esophagus.20 Moreover, we have shown that the expression of interleukin-36γ agonist can be strongly induced in keratinocytes after treatment with immunostimulating agents such as interleukin-1β and poly(I:C).
